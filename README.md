# Team Teri


## How this Repo is Organized

This Repo contains my own 'study notes' as I learn **genomic-scale cloud bioinformatics**. It includes descriptions of common tools, platforms and summaries of my work with clients. I update this Repo frequently. It is organized via the folder structure shown below.

- üóíÔ∏è **Concepts and Terms** (genomics files types, use cases, terminology and also whitepapers)
- üî¨ **Lab Testing** (Illumina and more)
- ‚öíÔ∏è **Genomic Tools** (GATK, VariantSpark, HAIL and many more - this section updates OFTEN)
- üì¶ **Genomics Platforms** (Terra.bio, Galaxy Project, IDSeq and others)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Public Cloud Genomics** (Alibaba Cloud, AWS, Azure or GCP). The general approach is to implement a cloud-native Data Lake pattern for scalable genomic analysis. A conceptual rendering of this pattern is shown below.
- üìö **LLMs for Bioinformatics** (Reading List).  So many papers and tools are being published in this area.  Here's what I am reading now.

## More Cloud/Genomics Reources

In addition to this Repo, I have a number of other Repos with cloud bioinformatics information. Also, I've included two of my favorite link aggregator resources here for additional learning.

### My GitHub Open Source Courses

- :octocat: GENERAL CLOUD - my `learn-cloud` Repo - https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud
- :octocat: GCP - my `gcp-for-bioinformatics` open source course - https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics
- :octocat: AWS - my `aws-for-bioinformatics` open source course - https://github.com/lynnlangit/aws-for-bioinformatics
- :octocat: WDL language - my `learn-wdl` open source course - https://github.com/openwdl/learn-wdl

### Repos with Links

- :octocat: `awesome-bioinformatics`(collection of links) - [link](https://github.com/openbiox/awosome-bioinformatics) with large number of curated links for learning about bioinformatics tools and topics
- :octocat: `awesome-bioinformatics-benchmarks` (collection of papers) - [link](https://github.com/j-andrews7/awesome-bioinformatics-benchmarks) links to published benchmark papers for bioinformatics

## Who is Teri?

Teri is the impetus for my movement into the world of genomic research. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016. She survived, but suffered a long course of intense and painful treatment due in part to the lack of availability of personalized treatment options at the time of her diagnosis.
